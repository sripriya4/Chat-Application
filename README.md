# Chat-Application
Communication is a mean for people to exchange messages. It  has started since the beginning of human creation. Chatting is a method of using  technology to bring people and ideas together despite of the geographical  barriers. The technology has been available for years but the acceptance was  quite recent. Our project is an example of a chat server. Our objective is to  create a chat application with a server and users to enable to chat with each  other. To develop an instant messaging solution to enable users to seamlessly  communicate with each other. The project is very easy to use enabling even a  novice person to use it.
